## Performance Optimization

### Critical CSS
```gherkin
Feature: Critical CSS Optimization
  As a WordPress site owner
  I want my site's CSS to load efficiently
  So that my Core Web Vitals scores improve

  Scenario: Admin styles are excluded
    Given I have WordPress with admin styles
    When the plugin processes the CSS
    Then admin-specific styles should be excluded
    And frontend styles should remain intact

  Scenario: Theme compatibility
    Given I switch WordPress themes
    When the plugin processes the CSS
    Then the theme should display correctly
    And performance should remain optimized
```

### Script Optimization
```gherkin

  As a WordPress site owner
  I want non-critical scripts to load efficiently
  So that my page loads faster

  Scenario: Analytics script handling
    Given I have Google Analytics installed
    When the page loads
    Then the analytics script should have async attribute
    And core WordPress scripts should load normally

  Scenario: Core functionality preservation
    Given I have jQuery-dependent features
    When the page loads
    Then all jQuery functionality should work
    And no JavaScript errors should occur
```
